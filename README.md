# Kaspa Ridehailing Platform

Kaspa Ridehailing is a full-stack smart mobility web platform built in PHP with a T-SQL database backend. Its an open-source alternative for transportation apps such as UBER, BOLT,WAYMO etc. Uses the ultra fast and secure Kaspa network for payments and several other features.

Core capabilities include:
- Passenger, driver, and operator role-based workflows
- Ride-hailing request, dispatch, trip lifecycle, and messaging
- Geofence-aware routing, bridges, and segmented trips
- Autonomous vehicle ride management
- Carshare operations (zones, bookings, rentals, tele-drive requests)
- Kaspa-based payment configuration and hybrid payment support
- Reporting, safety, audit, and GDPR-related operations

---

## Deployment Context

- This repository can be run locally for development and testing.
- The team’s primary/official deployment is hosted on a university-managed server.
- The application can also be deployed on commercial hosting infrastructure.

### Geographic Showcase Scope

- The current showcase configuration is designed for the **Republic of Cyprus**.
- Seeded geofences, bridges, autonomous coverage, and carshare zones are Cyprus-specific in the default dataset.
- To expand operational range to other cities/countries, seed new geofences (and related bridge/zone data) that cover the required service area.

---

## Compatibility Matrix

### Web Server Compatibility

The platform runs on local or commercial web servers as long as they support PHP and SQL Server connectivity.

Common supported patterns:
- Apache (Linux/Windows)
- Nginx + PHP-FPM
- IIS (Windows)

### Database Compatibility

- Native target: Microsoft SQL Server (including SQL Server Express).
- Commercial database support: any production database engine/environment that supports T-SQL and the required SQL Server access path from PHP.
- Current PHP integration uses `sqlsrv`/`pdo_sqlsrv`, so SQL Server-compatible connectivity is required at runtime.

---

## Architecture Overview

### Application Layer

- Root-level entry/auth pages: login, registration, profile, errors
- Role modules:
  - `passenger/`
  - `driver/`
  - `operator/`
- Feature modules:
  - `carshare/` + `carshare/api/`
- Centralized configuration under `config/`

### Database Layer

Database scripts are in `Database/` and include:
- Full schema creation (`tables`)
- Performance indexes (`indexes`)
- Stored procedures (`sp`) for operational workflows
- Triggers (`triggers`) for auditing/constraints
- Seed data and simulation/stress data
- Drop scripts for reset/rebuild workflows

---

## How the Platform Works (End-to-End)

This section documents the operational behavior of the platform across all mobility modes.

### 1) Identity and role model

- `User` is the base account.
- Each account can be linked to role tables: `Passenger`, `Driver`, `Operator`.
- Main role UX is separated by module:
  - Passenger flows in `passenger/`
  - Driver flows in `driver/`
  - Operator flows in `operator/`
  - CarShare customer mode in `carshare/`

### 2) Ride-hailing workflow (passenger -> driver)

Passenger request path:
1. Passenger opens `passenger/request_ride.php`.
2. System blocks duplicate active mobility sessions (active driver trip, active autonomous ride, or active carshare booking).
3. Passenger selects pickup/dropoff on map; backend inserts both via `spInsertLocation`.
4. Ride request is created via `spCreateRideRequest` with service type, payment method, accessibility/luggage options, and estimated route metrics.
5. If the trip is multi-geofence and path-based routing is selected, segment generation is performed via `spCalculateRideSegments` (with geofence path search logic through `spFindGeofencePaths`).

Request lifecycle and assignment:
- Passenger waits on `passenger/request_status.php` until a trip is assigned.
- Drivers retrieve eligible requests via `spDriverGetAvailableRideRequests`.
- Driver accepts via `spDriverAcceptRideRequest` (or `spDriverAcceptSegmentRequest` / `spAssignDriverToSegment` for segment journeys).
- Trip then appears in passenger `ride_detail.php` and driver `trip_detail.php` / `trips_assigned.php`.

Trip execution and completion:
- Trip starts via `spStartTrip` / driver status update procedures.
- Trip ends via `spCompleteTrip` (or real-driver conclusion procedures when GPS/manual flow is used).
- Passenger sees final status, can rate the trip, and can complete payment from trip detail.

### 3) Driver city/geofence settings and in-city acceptance model

Driver availability is geofence-bound:
1. Driver opens `driver/settings.php`.
2. Driver selects active vehicle and map location.
3. `spDriverGoOnline` binds the driver/vehicle to the detected district geofence (city area).
4. Driver receives only location-eligible requests for that operational area through availability procedures.
5. Driver can go offline via `spDriverGoOffline`.

Operational implications:
- Driver supply is city/geofence scoped, not globally unconstrained.
- Segment trips allow handoff across districts/bridges when one driver cannot serve full A->B route.

### 4) Autonomous ride workflow

Passenger autonomous request path (`passenger/request_autonomous_ride.php`):
1. Passenger chooses pickup/dropoff and payment method.
2. System enforces no parallel active ride mode (same exclusivity checks as regular rides).
3. Route geometry and zone validity are validated for autonomous operation.
4. Ride is created via `spCreateAutonomousRide` with automatic AV selection (or explicit vehicle if provided).

Autonomous dispatch and tracking:
- AV inventory/selection uses autonomous procedures such as:
  - `spGetAvailableAutonomousVehicles`
  - `spGetNearestAutonomousVehicle`
  - `spCreateAutonomousRide`
- Passenger tracks on `passenger/autonomous_ride_detail.php`.
- Ride status transitions are managed through:
  - `spUpdateAutonomousRideStatus`
  - `spCompleteAutonomousRide`
  - `spCancelAutonomousRide`
- Vehicle telemetry/location updates use `spUpdateAutonomousVehicleLocation`.

Operator AV control:
- Operators manage AV fleet in `operator/autonomous_vehicles.php` and related hub pages.
- Vehicle status actions (available/offline/maintenance) call `spUpdateAutonomousVehicleStatus`.

### 5) CarShare workflow (register -> approve -> book -> tele-drive -> unlock -> rental -> return)

Customer onboarding:
1. Passenger registers as carshare customer in `carshare/register.php`.
2. License/ID docs are uploaded and stored in filesystem; paths are persisted.
3. Operator reviews in `operator/carshare_approvals.php` and sets status (`pending`/`approved`/`rejected`).

Vehicle discovery and reservation:
1. Search via `carshare/api/carshare_search.php` (calls `spCarshareSearchVehicles`).
2. Book via `carshare/api/carshare_book.php`:
   - approval checks
   - active-ride exclusivity checks
   - active-booking checks
   - booking creation (20-minute unlock window)

Tele-drive delivery (optional):
- Customer can request remote repositioning via `carshare/api/tele_drive_request.php`.
- Session progress/speed is tracked in `carshare/api/tele_drive_status.php`.

Start and end rental:
- Start/unlock via `carshare/api/carshare_start.php`.
- End via `carshare/api/carshare_end.php`, which calculates:
  - time cost + distance cost
  - inter-city fees
  - out-of-zone penalties
  - low-fuel penalties
  - geofence crossing fee logic
  - bonus credits for specific return zones
- System updates booking/rental/vehicle states and creates carshare payment records.

### 6) Payments model (ride-hailing, segment, autonomous, carshare)

Supported seeded payment methods:
- `CASH`
- `KASPA`

Ride-hailing payment flows:
- Trip-level payment lifecycle uses procedures such as:
  - `spCreatePaymentForTrip`
  - `spCompletePayment`
  - `spCompleteTripPayment`
  - `spProcessTripPayment`
- Segment journeys can use per-segment payments:
  - `spCreatePaymentForSegment`
  - `spGetSegmentPayment`
  - `spCompleteSegmentPayment`

Application behavior:
- Passenger trip detail page handles payment creation and completion.
- Kaspa payment flows include transaction-hash verification checks before completion.
- CarShare generates payment at rental closure.
- Autonomous payment records are tracked in autonomous payment tables/procedures.

### 7) Operator operations workflow

Operator control planes include:
- Main operations dashboard: `operator/dashboard.php`
- Driver operations hub/map/list: `operator/drivers_hub.php`, `operator/driver_map.php`, `operator/drivers.php`
- Safety/compliance: `operator/safety_inspections.php`, document/driver verification views
- CarShare operations hub: approvals, vehicles, zones
- Autonomous operations hub: vehicle map/list/detail and ride monitoring
- Reports: financial, operational, and system logs

Database support includes operator-focused procedures for:
- dashboard stats
- dispatch/assignment visibility
- driver and earnings reports
- carshare approval and lifecycle oversight
- autonomous fleet and ride management

### 8) Seeded data and operator bootstrap

Base seeding (`OSRH_kaspa_seeding.sql`) includes:
- payment methods (Cash, Kaspa)
- service types and mappings
- district geofences and bridges
- autonomous fleet seed (15 vehicles)
- carshare seed set (types, 23 zones, 25 vehicles, operating area polygon)

Operator account bootstrap:
- Base seeding does **not** insert a default operator row directly.
- Bootstrap options provided by the project:
  - register operator via `spRegisterOperator`
  - promote an existing passenger via `spPromotePassengerToOperator`
  - use helper script: `Database/OSRH_kaspa_promote_passenger_to_operator.sql`

Recommended bootstrap sequence after seeding:
1. Create at least one passenger/admin candidate account.
2. Run `OSRH_kaspa_promote_passenger_to_operator.sql` (or call `spRegisterOperator`).
3. Log in through operator module and begin approvals/operations.

---

## Local Prerequisites

- PHP 8.x (aligned with your local runtime)
- Apache/Nginx/IIS (XAMPP Apache is the quickest local path)
- Microsoft SQL Server / SQL Server Express
- SQL Server PHP drivers enabled:
  - `php_sqlsrv`
  - `php_pdo_sqlsrv`
- SQL Server Management Studio (recommended for schema execution)

---

## Local Setup (Developer Runbook)

### 1) Place project in web root

Example (XAMPP):

```text
C:\xampp\htdocs\osrh
```

### 2) Configure application settings

Edit `config/config.php`:
- `APP_ENV = development`
- `BASE_URL = http://localhost/osrh/` (or your chosen local path)
- `DB_HOST` (example `localhost\SQLEXPRESS`)
- `DB_DATABASE` (default in project configs is `OSRH_DB`)

`config/database.php` uses `sqlsrv_connect(...)`; make sure SQLSRV extension loading is valid in `php.ini`.

### 3) Enable SQLSRV extensions

In `php.ini`, ensure:

```ini
extension=php_sqlsrv.dll
extension=php_pdo_sqlsrv.dll
```

Restart the web server after changes.

### 4) Create database

Create database (example):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE OSRH_DB;
GO
```

### 5) Execute database scripts in order

Use SSMS (or equivalent SQL tool) and run scripts in this order:

1. `Database/OSRH_kaspa_tables.sql`
2. `Database/OSRH_kaspa_indexes.sql`
3. `Database/OSRH_kaspa_sp.sql`
4. `Database/OSRH_kaspa_triggers.sql`
5. `Database/OSRH_kaspa_seeding.sql`

Optional datasets and test tooling:
6. `Database/OSRH_kaspa_simulated_drivers_seeding.sql` (large simulated driver population)
7. `Database/OSRH_kaspa_stress_test_data.sql` (heavy load dataset)
8. `Database/OSRH_kaspa_performance_tests.sql` (query/perf validation)

Operator bootstrap (required for operator dashboards):
9. Run `Database/OSRH_kaspa_promote_passenger_to_operator.sql` after you have a valid passenger to promote, or register directly with `spRegisterOperator`.

### 6) Start web server and run

Open:

```text
http://localhost/osrh/
```

---

## Database Lifecycle Operations

### Clean Rebuild (Dev/Staging Only)

For a full reset:
1. `Database/OSRH_kaspa_drop_sp.sql`
2. `Database/OSRH_kaspa_drop_tables.sql`
3. Re-run setup order from `tables` through `seeding`

Do not execute drop scripts on production systems.

### Role Promotion Utility

To promote a passenger to operator:
- Use `Database/OSRH_kaspa_promote_passenger_to_operator.sql`
- It executes `spPromotePassengerToOperator`

---

## Data Model Scope (High-Level)

The schema includes core domains for:
- Identity and auth (`User`, `PasswordHistory`, role tables)
- Driver/vehicle onboarding and compliance documents
- Geospatial entities (`Location`, `Geofence`, bridge/link tables)
- Ride lifecycle (`RideRequest`, `Trip`, `TripLeg`, logs)
- Payments/ratings/messaging
- GDPR request management and audit logs
- Autonomous ride entities
- Carshare entities (zones, vehicles, bookings, rentals, payments, logs)

---

## Stored Procedure Layer

`Database/OSRH_kaspa_sp.sql` contains extensive operational procedures for:
- Registration/login/security operations
- Driver dispatch and assignment flows
- Trip state transitions and validations
- Fare and dynamic pricing logic
- Segment/geofence routing operations
- Financial and operational reporting
- Autonomous and carshare workflows

This procedure-first approach centralizes business logic in the database for consistency and reporting integrity.

---

## Trigger and Audit Behavior

`Database/OSRH_kaspa_triggers.sql` implements:
- Audit logging for critical transactional tables
- Status-change monitoring
- Semantic validation (example: rating constraints)
- Derived updates (example: driver rating aggregation)

---

## Runtime Entry Points

Main application pages:
- `/index.php`
- `/login.php`
- `/register_driver.php`
- `/register_passenger.php`

Role dashboards:
- Passenger: `/passenger/dashboard.php`
- Driver: `/driver/dashboard.php`
- Operator: `/operator/dashboard.php`

---

## Kaspa Configuration

Kaspa settings are in `config/kaspa_config.php`.

Key parameters include:
- `KASPA_NETWORK`
- `KASPA_API_URL`
- `KASPA_OSRH_WALLET`
- payment confirmation/expiry controls

Use environment variables for production-sensitive values.

---

## Production Hardening Checklist

- Set `APP_ENV` to production
- Disable debug output in production
- Use HTTPS + secure cookie/session settings
- Keep secrets out of source control
- Limit DB permissions by role/environment
- Back up database before schema/data migrations
- Restrict access to admin/operator endpoints by policy

---

## Troubleshooting

### SQLSRV extension missing

- Verify `php_sqlsrv` and `php_pdo_sqlsrv` are enabled
- Ensure extension binaries match PHP version + architecture
- Restart the web server

### Database connection failure

- Validate `DB_HOST` and instance name
- Validate `DB_DATABASE` exists
- Check SQL Server service state and firewall rules
- Test credentials/connectivity in SSMS

### Route/base URL issues

- Ensure project folder path matches `BASE_URL`
- Confirm document root points to the expected directory

## Hosting the PHP Backend and SQL Server

The React frontend (deployable on Vercel) is a static SPA that calls the PHP backend over HTTPS.
The **PHP backend** and the **SQL Server database** must each run on a server that is publicly
reachable from the internet so that both the frontend and end-users can access them.

---

### Where to host the PHP backend

The backend is a plain PHP application that uses the `sqlsrv`/`pdo_sqlsrv` extension to talk to
SQL Server. Any host that provides PHP 8.x with those extensions available is suitable.

| Option | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **VPS / Cloud VM** (DigitalOcean, Linode, Hetzner, AWS EC2, Azure VM, etc.) | Full control. Install Apache or Nginx + PHP-FPM + the [Microsoft SQLSRV extension for PHP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/php/installation-tutorial-linux-mac). Point document root at `OSRH_KASPA_PHP/`. |
| **Render (Docker)** | Create a `Dockerfile` in `OSRH_KASPA_PHP/` based on `php:8.2-apache`, install the SQLSRV PECL extension, and deploy as a Web Service. Render provides a public HTTPS URL automatically. |
| **Railway** | Use a Railway service with a custom Dockerfile (same as Render approach). Railway can also host the SQL Server database in the same project. |
| **Shared hosting / cPanel** | Only viable if the host provides the `sqlsrv` PHP extension. Most shared hosts do **not** include it; verify before choosing this option. |
| **University / institutional server** | The team's official deployment target. Works as long as the server runs PHP 8.x with SQLSRV drivers and can reach the SQL Server instance. |

**Minimum PHP setup on any Linux host:**

```bash
# Install PHP 8.x + Apache (Ubuntu/Debian example)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apache2 php8.2 php8.2-cli php8.2-common \
    php8.2-curl php8.2-mbstring php8.2-xml unzip curl

# Install Microsoft ODBC driver (required by sqlsrv)
# Replace 22.04 below with your Ubuntu version: $(lsb_release -rs)
curl -fsSL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc \
    | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/microsoft-prod.gpg
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/22.04/prod.list \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list
sudo apt-get update
ACCEPT_EULA=Y sudo apt-get install -y msodbcsql18

# Install SQLSRV PHP extension via PECL
sudo pecl install sqlsrv pdo_sqlsrv
echo "extension=sqlsrv.so"     | sudo tee /etc/php/8.2/apache2/conf.d/30-sqlsrv.ini
echo "extension=pdo_sqlsrv.so" | sudo tee /etc/php/8.2/apache2/conf.d/30-pdo_sqlsrv.ini
sudo service apache2 restart

# Deploy the application (run from the root of the cloned repository)
sudo cp -r OSRH_KASPA_PHP /var/www/html/osrh
```

---

### Where to host SQL Server

| Option | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Azure SQL Database** (recommended for cloud) | Fully managed, serverless tier available for low-cost/dev use. Accessible from any internet host via TCP 1433. Uses SQL authentication (`DB_USERNAME` / `DB_PASSWORD`). Free trial available. |
| **SQL Server on the same VPS as PHP** | Install SQL Server Express (free) on the same VM that runs PHP. Use `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1,1433`) as `DB_HOST`. Zero network latency between PHP and SQL Server. |
| **SQL Server on a separate VM** | Suitable for larger deployments. Open TCP 1433 in the firewall and use the VM's private IP (within a VPC/VNet) or public IP as `DB_HOST`. |
| **Railway MSSQL service** | One-click MSSQL container in the same Railway project as the PHP service. Use the Railway-provided internal hostname as `DB_HOST`. |
| **University / institutional SQL Server** | The team's current production target. Accessible only from within the university network or via VPN. |

**Create the database (run once on any target):**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE OSRH_DB;
GO
```

Then execute the setup scripts in order (see [Execute database scripts in order](#5-execute-database-scripts-in-order)).

---

### Wiring the PHP backend to SQL Server

Edit `OSRH_KASPA_PHP/config/config.php` with the values for your chosen host:

```php
// ---------- DATABASE SETTINGS ----------
define('DB_HOST',     'your-sql-server-host.example.com');  // hostname or IP; append ,1433 if needed
define('DB_DATABASE', 'OSRH_DB');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'osrh_user');   // SQL Server login
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'StrongPass!'); // SQL Server password
```

> **Windows Authentication vs. SQL Authentication**
> - On a local Windows machine (XAMPP + SQL Server Express) you can use Windows Authentication by
>   leaving `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` empty. The PHP process connects as the Windows user.
> - On any Linux server, or when the PHP host and SQL Server are on different machines, you **must**
>   use SQL Server Authentication: create a SQL login with appropriate permissions and fill in
>   `DB_USERNAME` / `DB_PASSWORD`.

Also update `BASE_URL` to the public HTTPS URL of the PHP host, and set `APP_ENV` to `production`.

---

### Quick-reference: recommended stack combinations

| Scenario | PHP host | SQL Server | Notes |
|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| **Low-cost cloud** | Render (Docker) | Azure SQL free tier | Free or near-free for small traffic |
| **All-in-one VPS** | Apache on VPS | SQL Server Express on same VPS | Simple; one machine to manage |
| **Railway project** | Railway (Docker) | Railway MSSQL service | One dashboard; internal networking |
| **University server** | University Apache/IIS | University SQL Server | Team's official production path |
| **Local development** | XAMPP (Windows) | SQL Server Express (local) | Fastest dev loop |

---

## Deploying to Vercel (Frontend)

Vercel is a static/serverless hosting platform. It can host the React/Vite **frontend** directly. The PHP backend and the SQL Server database must be hosted separately (see notes below).

### Database used

- **Engine**: Microsoft SQL Server (including SQL Server Express / Azure SQL)
- **Dialect**: T-SQL
- **PHP driver**: `sqlsrv` / `pdo_sqlsrv`
- All schema, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, and seed data are in the `Database/` folder.

### Architecture for a Vercel deployment

```
Browser  ──►  Vercel (React SPA)
                   │
                   │  HTTPS API calls  (VITE_API_URL)
                   ▼
         PHP Backend host  (Railway / Render / VPS / IIS, etc.)
                   │
                   │  sqlsrv / pdo_sqlsrv
                   ▼
         SQL Server  (Azure SQL / self-hosted MSSQL)
```

### Step-by-step: deploy the frontend to Vercel from scratch

#### 1. Set up the backend and database first

Before deploying the frontend you need a publicly reachable PHP backend with an active SQL Server database. Complete the [Local Setup](#local-setup-developer-runbook) steps on your chosen server/VPS, or use a managed service such as:

- **PHP hosting**: Railway, Render (Docker image with PHP + SQLSRV extension), or a VPS running Apache/Nginx + PHP-FPM.
- **SQL Server**: Azure SQL (free tier available), SQL Server on a VPS, or Railway MSSQL service.

Run the database scripts in order on your production database (using SSMS, Azure Data Studio, or `sqlcmd`):

```
1. Database/OSRH_kaspa_tables.sql
2. Database/OSRH_kaspa_indexes.sql
3. Database/OSRH_kaspa_sp.sql
4. Database/OSRH_kaspa_triggers.sql
5. Database/OSRH_kaspa_seeding.sql
```

Update `OSRH_KASPA_PHP/config/config.php` (or use environment variables) with your production `DB_HOST`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and set `APP_ENV` to `production` and `BASE_URL` to your backend's public URL.

#### 2. Import the project into Vercel

1. Push this repository to GitHub (already done if you are reading this).
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **Add New Project** → import the repository.
3. When prompted for the **Root Directory**, set it to **`frontend`** (this is where `package.json` and `vercel.json` live).
4. Vercel will auto-detect the **Vite** framework. Leave the default build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`

#### 3. Set the environment variable

In the Vercel project dashboard → **Settings → Environment Variables**, add:

| Name            | Value                                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `VITE_API_URL`  | `https://your-php-backend.example.com/osrh`   |

This tells the React app where to reach the PHP API. The `frontend/.env.example` file documents this variable.

#### 4. Deploy

Click **Deploy**. Vercel will run `npm run build` inside `frontend/`, produce a static `dist/` bundle, and publish it globally on the Vercel CDN. The `frontend/vercel.json` rewrite rule ensures that all client-side routes (e.g. `/passenger/dashboard`) are served by `index.html`.

#### 5. Operator bootstrap

After the database is live, follow the [operator bootstrap](#8-seeded-data-and-operator-bootstrap) steps to create the first operator account.
